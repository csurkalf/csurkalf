- 👋 Hi, I’m @csurkalf
- 👀 I’m interested in clinical trials, real world data and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything together, linux - basic python coding - AI and agents, too big to swallow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any clinica trial, pharma or healthcare related project if you need expertise from the area as I won't be a help on the coding side. :D
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn.
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't play that game.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Rainbow Dash.
